- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Spring Boot Java 17 SaaS backend with JWT, PostgreSQL, Redis, layered REST architecture).
- [x] Scaffold the Project (Spring Boot Maven layout created in workspace root).
- [x] Customize the Project (modules implemented per requirements).
- [x] Install Required Extensions (none requested).
- [x] Compile the Project (Maven Wrapper added, tests pass with Java 24 compatibility fixes).
- [x] Create and Run Task (set up tasks.json if needed after build works).
- [x] Launch the Project (run after successful build; confirm debug mode before launching).
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README and this file should reflect current state; confirm once build passes).

Execution Guidelines
- Track progress by updating this checklist directly.
- Keep communication concise; summarize command results instead of full logs.
- Use the workspace root `.` for commands; avoid creating extra folders.
- Do not install extensions unless specified; avoid external links/media unless asked.
- Project completion: scaffolded, compiled without errors, README up to date, launch instructions provided.
